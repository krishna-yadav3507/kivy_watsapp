# README #

I'm learning to build a **XMPP** app as a [Kivy](http://kivy.org/#home) application using this tutorial from [Dusty's Diverse Domain](http://archlinux.me/dusty)

### What is this repository for ? ###
 
* [Kivy](http://kivy.org/#home)  is an Open source Python library for rapid development of applications
that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.
* [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/history/) is the formalization of the base XML streaming protocols for instant messaging and presence developed within the Jabber community.
* Version 1
* This README was written using [Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### How do I get set up ? ###

* Setting up a development environment and other dependencies are well explained on this [Dusty's post](http://archlinux.me/dusty/2014/04/25/creating-apps-in-kivy-the-book/) and on the [Kivy.org ](http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/installation.html) installation page.
